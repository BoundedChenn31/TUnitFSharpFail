My failed attempt to run a single TUnit test written in F#.

`TUnitPlayground` - all interesting things are here:
- simple test
- code generated by TUnit rewritten to F# 
- code generate by new Microsoft Testing Platform rewritten to F#

`CSharpProj` - example of C#-test using TUnit

`TestEntryPoint` - Console "Hello world" project with added TUnit dependency which breaks build :)
